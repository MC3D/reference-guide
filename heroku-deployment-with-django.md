1. First thing you want to do is go to Heroku and create your Django app.

2. Copy and past the domain name generated by Heroko into your settings.py file inside the ALLOWED_HOSTS list. Copy and paste everything except the http protocol.

If you have the domain:

`https://agile-reaches-11764.herokuapp.com/`

only copy

`agile-reaches-11764.herokuapp.com/`

into the ALLOWED_HOSTS list. e.g.
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
	'localhost',
	'agile-reaches-11764.herokuapp.com/'
]
```

3. From the command line (from terminal), pipenv install gunicorn
```
pipenv install gunicorn whitenoise
```
4. Create your Procfile and add the following code (if you used something other than conf for your project folder, the your code will be different):
```
web: gunicorn conf.wisgi
```
5. Add white noise to MIDDLEWARE inside your settings.py file:
```
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    # Simplified static file serving.
    # https://warehouse.python.org/project/whitenoise/
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    ...
```
6. Add the following below the BASE_DIR variable inside your settings.py file:
```
# ======== STATIC FILE CONFIGURATION
# See: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#static-root
STATIC_ROOT = normpath(join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles'))

# See: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#static-url
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

# See: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#staticfiles-finders
STATICFILES_FINDERS = [
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
]
# ======== END STATIC FILE CONFIGURATION
```
MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE `STATIC_URL = '/static/'` FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE, SINCE WE MOVED IT UP UNDER THE BASE_DIR VARIABLE.


7. Setup your .gitignore and add the following:
```
.idea/
.DS_Store
__pycache__
```
8. Create a GitHub repo for your project
9. Push your code to GitHub
10. Connect Heroku to the project repo you just created on GitHub
11. This is how you link the main.js and styles.css inside your base.html:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/css/styles.css">

<script src="/static/js/main.js"></script>
```
